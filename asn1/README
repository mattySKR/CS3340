I have spent a very long time trying to make a custom Makefile as I remember how things were done in CS2211.
However, because I am working on CLion which has concrete makefile that cannot be modified, it is likely why
my custom makefile is not visible by the program. I just wanted to mention this as I spent a lot of time and it
would be sad to lose marks on this after I invested so much time on what should not be a complex issue.
-------------------------------------------
So, to run my program(s), I execute:

make asn1_a

./asn1_a

-------------------------------------------
In the script, however, I used:

time ./asn1_a

as it will also show the time taken to compute the algorithm.
-------------------------------------------
Thank you.
